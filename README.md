# 8086 Instruction Set Reference

A modern, responsive documentation reference for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

This project aims to modernize the experience of reading assembly documentation. It replaces legacy, table-based layouts with a structured "shelf" interface, making it easier for students, developers, and hobbyists to browse technical specifications on any device.

🚀 Key Features

Visual Flag Register: Flags (ZF, CF, etc.) are clearly visualized with color-coded indicators, allowing developers to instantly see which processor states are modified, set, or cleared by an instruction.

Single-File Architecture: The entire application uses a modern frontend approach but compiles into a single HTML file. It requires no installation, no build steps, and works entirely offline.

Search & Navigation: Instructions can be filtered instantly by mnemonic or category, with a collapsible sidebar for efficient browsing.

Dark Mode Interface: A high-contrast, eye-friendly theme inspired by modern IDEs (Treesitter/Neovim) for comfortable reading during long coding sessions.

📚 References & Accuracy

This tool is designed as a quick reference. The technical data, including opcodes, algorithmic logic, and flag behaviors, is based on standard architecture documentation.

Primary Source: Standard 8086 architecture documentation.

Standard: General x86 Instruction Set references.

🤝 Contributing

Accuracy is paramount for a technical reference. While the data has been checked against standard manuals, the complexity of the 8086 architecture means edge-case errors are possible.

The developer community is encouraged to help maintain this resource:

If you identify an error in an opcode, flag state, or description, please Open an Issue.

Pull Requests are welcome for corrections or UI improvements.
