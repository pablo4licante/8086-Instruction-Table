# 8086 Instruction Set Reference

A modern, responsive documentation reference for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

This project modernizes how assembly documentation is viewed. Instead of legacy table-based layouts, it uses a structured, bookshelf-style interface that makes browsing technical specifications intuitive across all devices.

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Visual Flag Register**

Flags such as **ZF**, **CF**, and others are displayed using color-coded indicators, making it easy to see which processor states are *modified*, *set*, or *cleared* by each instruction.

### **Single-File Architecture**

The entire interface is built with a modern frontend approach but compiles into **one standalone HTML file**—
no installation, no build steps, fully offline.

### **Search & Navigation**

Instant instruction filtering by mnemonic or category, paired with a collapsible sidebar for efficient browsing.

### **Dark Mode Interface**

A high-contrast theme inspired by modern IDEs (e.g., Treesitter/Neovim) provides comfortable reading for long study or development sessions.

## 🤝 Contributing

Accuracy is critical for any technical reference. While the dataset has been validated against official documentation, the complexity of the 8086 instruction set means occasional edge-case errors may occur.

Contributions from the community are encouraged:

* Found an incorrect opcode, flag state, or description? **Open an Issue**
* Want to improve accuracy or enhance UI/UX? **Pull Requests welcome**
